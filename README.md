# FedShield

**FedShield** is a privacy-preserving Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system that uses Federated Learning to train image classification models across decentralized clients. It enables organizations to detect and prevent the leakage of sensitive information (e.g., screenshots of credentials, IDs, bank details) in images—**without centralizing data**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of image-based content sharing (e.g., social media, screen captures), organizations face a major challenge: sensitive data can be leaked unintentionally via images. Traditional DLP systems require centralized data access, which poses privacy and security risks.

## 🧠 Solution: FedShield

FedShield tackles this by using **Federated Learning**, which allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model **without transferring local data**. This ensures privacy while enabling the system to learn how to classify sensitive vs non-sensitive images.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Federated Learning-enabled image classifier**
- 🔒 **Privacy-preserving**: No raw data leaves the device
- 🖼️ **CNN-based model** for image classification
- ⚡ Lightweight and scalable for distributed environments
- 📊 Supports centralized training for comparison
